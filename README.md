# Javascript Brick Break Game

Teaching myself how to code with javascript here...

This is a basic Javascript application in it's early stages. The game definatly needs some tweaking.

Few things to work on - 

* Ball hits bottom line and not paddle itself
* Ball hits center of brick and not outside
* Be able to change the balls direction depending on where it hits the paddle
* Different color bricks on each row
* more levels
* Timer
* High scores with fastest time level is beat
